# Networks University Project

This is a java network programming project I had to code for a university course. In this project I had to make a connection with my tutor's server through a virtual modem in my computer. My code had to send requests to the online server and recieve packages, images and GPS coordinates. 

The source code is the virtualModem file inside the src folder.
